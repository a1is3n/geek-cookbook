# Premix is now public

This is a copy of an [update I recently sent](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin/dashboard/updates) to my GitHub sponsors..

After some reflection, I've made the decision to make the Geek Cookbook [Premix](/premix/) repo public, rather than sponsors-only. Instead of switching the private repo to public (*which would [potentially expose all of your forks](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)*), I've created a fresh repository at [geek-cookbook/premix](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/premix/), and will leave the private repo as-is.

My reasoning as is follows:

1. I've been neglecting it / you. Over the past 14 months, I've spent all my spare time / funds building [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/) (*read about the journey in the monthly reports [here](https://elfhosted.com/open/)*), and it's only just showing signs of [becoming self-sustaining](https://elfhosted.com/open/jul-2024/).

    It's unrealistic to think that I'll have time/focus in the short-term to hack on recipes / premix, so in offering repo access in exchange for sponsorship, I'm setting a false expectation for support / updates.

2. Some of the recipes / premixes need a "fresh coat of paint", and making the repo public will hopefully encourage more PRs and community engagement.

I realize that premix access may have been your primary motivator for sponsoring me, and so you have my blessing to "un-sponsor" if you'd prefer...

Still here? Thank you for sticking with me ❤️ , and please feel free to hit me up in [Discord][discord] with questions / comments / ideas / requests, I'd love to hear from you! :)

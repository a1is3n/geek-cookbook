!!! tip "Fast-track with premix! 🚀"
    "[Premix](/premix/)" is a git repository which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that you can launch any recipe with just a `git pull` and a `docker stack deploy` 👍.

    🚀 **Update**: Premix now includes an ansible playbook, enabling you to deploy an entire stack + recipes, with a single ansible command! (*more [here](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/premix/ansible/operation/)*)
